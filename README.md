# CsvFileUploaderAndDownloader
A simple web application that will accept the upload of a CSV file. The CSV file is attached and represents what should be a tree like structure. This CSV file should be read, validated (errors reported), and then persisted to a strongly typed storage table (SQL Server preferred) so that it may be downloaded at a later time.
