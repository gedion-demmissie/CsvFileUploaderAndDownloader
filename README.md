# CsvFileUploaderAndDownloader
A simple web application that will accept the upload of a CSV file. The CSV file will be required as  attachement that represents what should be a tree like structure. The application consumes this CSV file , validate it (reports errors), and then persist it to a strongly typed storage table (SQL Server preferred) so that it may be downloaded at a later time.
